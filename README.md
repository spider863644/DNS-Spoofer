# DNS-Spoofing
DNS Spoofing is a technique that manipulates DNS responses to redirect a victim's internet traffic. Instead of resolving a domain to its legitimate IP address, it points to a fake IP, leading users to malicious sites. Itâ€™s used in phishing, malware distribution, or penetration testing to expose DNS vulnerabilities.
